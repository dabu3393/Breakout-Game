## Getting Started

The Breakout Game is a classic arcade game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to use a paddle to bounce a ball and break a wall of bricks. The player's goal is to clear all the bricks while preventing the ball from falling off the screen.

## Key Features

- **Paddle and Ball**: Control a paddle to bounce a ball and prevent it from falling off the screen.

- **Brick Wall**: Break a wall of bricks by bouncing the ball into them.

- **Scoring**: Earn points for each brick broken. Try to achieve the highest score.

- **Lives**: You have a limited number of lives. If the ball falls off the screen, you lose a life.

- **Speed Control**: The game becomes progressively faster as you play.

- **Game Over**: The game ends when you run out of lives or clear all the bricks.

- **Keyboard Controls**: Use the "Left" and "Right" arrow keys to move the paddle.

## Usage
1. Run the breakout_game.py script to start the game.
2. Use the "Left" and "Right" arrow keys to move the paddle left and right.
3. Bounce the ball off the paddle to hit the bricks.
4. Try to clear all the bricks while keeping the ball in play.
5. Score points for each brick broken.
6. The game ends when you run out of lives or clear all the bricks.
